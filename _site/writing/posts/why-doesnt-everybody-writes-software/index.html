          <h3>29-10-20</h3>
    <p><p>I’ve been thinking about software. About writing software. About <em>writing</em> software. We don’t speak nor we draw software (although that could be interesting to try), we write it. Isn’t that curious? t’s like this words by themselves could potentially be software.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you take a piece of code, say a Python script, and write it down on a piece of paper then it becomes useless! meaningless! almost like a curse!</p>
<p>So what amazes me the most about writing software is its capability to be done by almost anyone who knows how to write. But, is it?</p>
<p>If you are able to <em>write</em>, does that turns you into a <em>writer</em>? if you are able to <em>speak</em>, does that turns you into a <em>speaker</em>? If you are able to <em>move</em>, does that turns you into a <em>dancer</em>?</p>
<p>Lets take those professions and distill their purposes, or what I believe their purposes are.</p>
<p>When we write, are we writing for ourselves or for someone else? are we writing out of our mouth, or are we writing delicately to communicate ideas or feelings in a certain way so that others are able to understand what we are trying to say?</p>
<p><img src="img/jack-kerouac.jpeg" alt="Jack Kerouac">
<span class="text-xs text-gray-500">if you know how to write, are you a writer?</span></p>
<p>When we speak, are we chatting with our friends while we take some coffee, or are we talking to an audience? Are we singing in the shower or are we performing for a crowd?</p>
<p>When we move, are we doing because we use it as a transportation mechanism or because we are trying to express a deep and complex feeling through our body?</p>
<p>I believe that, in the case of a writer, this is mainly someone who writes for others. It is someone who wants to be read by others. So taking down my course notes is not going to make me a writer. But showing them to others over the internet certainly does. I might be a bad writer, but aren’t there a whole lot of those that publish books and call themselves writers?</p>
<p>A developer (or programmer, or hacker, or whatever satisfies you to call that) is someone who builds systems for users. Coherent, modular and clear pieces of code that work together towards a specific aim or task that can satisfy its users concerns.</p>
<p>So a writer is writing for others to read, and a developer is building for others to use, as well as a speaker is talking to people to listen to and a dancer is moving so others can experience some sort of emotion.</p>
<p>There lays one of the core ideas of all of those professions mentioned before: we need the purpose of delivering something to others in order to be a writer/speaker/dancer/developer.</p>
<p>Having a purpose as a coder is a <strong>necessary</strong> condition, of course. Otherwise, how can you be a developer if you don’t have in mind a project to build or a problem to solve? but it is not a <strong>sufficient</strong> one.</p>

<span class="text-xs text-gray-500"> Being in the pink region is sufficient for being in A, but not necessary. Being in A is necessary for being in the pink region, but not sufficient. Being in A and being in B is necessary and sufficient for being in the pink region.</span></p>
<p>I’m able to propose at least two reasons why there is a lot of people who are not coding today.

<p>The first one is being unable to identify that programming is a tool to support your problem-solving framework on you own domain. Just like Word does for you, just like Zoom does. Think for a minute in areas such as the Digital Humanities, or Generative Art or Computational Social Science. There is indeed a niche in each of those worlds, but why isn’t it more popular to make use of the tools programming has for you? it probably is the tool’s fault. It probably is that these people are not building their own tools, because they don’t have the tools to do it.</p>
<p>The second one relates to the first one: there is an access barrier. These tools might in some way still be too rough and unfriendly to try them if you do not have a training as a software engineer or similar. Oh, are you a software engineer and have been frightened to look over some API documentation sometime? imagine someone who is completely alien to this world. It is a reason to never come back.</p>
<p>But there is also another access barrier which native English speakers might not be aware of: language.</p>
<p>Yes, every programming language that you know and use is in English. All the docs are written in English, all the tutorials are too (well, almost all). In fact, at this stage we might consider English as the lingua franca of the Internet, and certainly of the software industry.</p>
<p>The big question is, how do we get to incorporate more people to write software?
Is it by creating new programming languages? Is it by adapting what we already have? How do we enable those excluded people to engage with an enormous part of our culture?</p>
